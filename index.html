<h2>What is Bible Beehive?</h2>

<p>Bible Beehive is a collaborative web tool for Bible translation teams. It is
particularly aimed at teams in difficult contexts targeting languages where
there is no existing Bible translation, and where users may struggle with more
advanced software like Paratext.</p>

<h2>Why was Bible Beehive started?</h2>

<p>My team and I are working in the developing world to produce a new translation
of the New Testament in a language where almost no Bible resources exist.
Because we could not find Bible translation software that met our needs, we
developed our own, with the working title of "Bible Beehive". As the team
worked through the translation of the NT over three years, the software was
continually developed and improved. We now want to share this software with
other Bible translation teams.</p>

<h2>Who is behind Bible Beehive?</h2>

<p>We are working in a context which makes it difficult for us to share our
identities publicly. We are a team believers in the Lord Jesus, we are on the
ground, and we are working in partnership with a well-known and trusted Bible
translation organisation. The software itself was developed by one person on
the team with programming abilities. Please <a href="https://forms.gle/AS6XUwPbHQzsNzj97">contact us</a> if you want to know more
about us.</p>

<h2>What features does Bible Beehive have?</h2>

<p>Bible Beehive has many features already! <b>In summary, it has: comments, back
translation, consultant review, key word highlighting, mandatory peer review,
recruiting features, community testing features, simple progress tracking, and
the ability to export to Paratext.</b></p>

  <summary>Click to read more about all Bible Beehive's features</summary>
  <ul>
    <li>In order for a proposed translation of a verse to make it to the final text, it must be approved by at least two users. <span class="note">(This personally is my favourite feature of Bible Beehive. This approach increased the quality of our work substantially, in my opinion, and it provided us with the confidence that the last user to modify the text didn't accidentally introduce an error.)</span></li>
    <li>Log in using Google, or using your email address and password. <span class="note">(Our team struggled to log in with a username and password, hence why we developed the ability to log in with Google.)</span></li>
    <li>Adjust the interface into different languages.</li>
    <li>The verse is displayed in different languages and in different Bible translations all in one page. <span class="note">(Our team prefers having everything all in one page, as many of our users struggle with window management.)</span></li>
    <li>Each proposed translation of a verse is listed all in one page. It is easy to see who approved (or disapproved) a particular proposed translation.</li>
    <li>Back translators can translate the verses into a different language.</li>
    <li>Back translators cannot see the identities of the other users on the website. <span class="note">(This allowed us to more easily recruit back translators who were non-believers.)</span></li>
    <li>The consultant can ask questions and mark verses as needing correction or not needing correction.</li>
    <li>Users can leave comments on proposed translations of a verse, and comment threads can be closed. <span class="note">(This was more useful than email or instant messaging to our team.)</span></li>
    <li>The website can track the progress of the translation in multiple steps
    (first draft, reverification, back translation, consultant review, and
    response to the consultant review.) <span class="note">(This was helpful to
    provide a sense of momentum and accomplishment as we watched the percentages
    near 100%.)</span></li>
    <li>The text can be exported to Paratext.</li>
    <li>Key terms can be marked on the website with guidance created by the team. Verses are displayed with those key terms highlighted and linked.</li>
    <li>The text can be shared online on a separate website with a custom domain. Visitors can privately leave feedback without creating an account. <span class="note">(This was a good way for us to get feedback from the community of believers outside of the team.)</span></li>
    <li>Books can be locked to prevent further modification.</li>
    <li>Users have profiles where you can view the history of their activity.</li>
    <li>Printing books and chapters is simple.</li>
    <li>Changes can be displayed easily.</li>
    <li>New recruits can be given a particular passage to translate as part of the interviewing process. They will not be able to see other users' work or their identieties. <span class="note">(This helped us enourmously when recruiting.)</span></li>
    <li>It is easy to search across verses in different languages.</li>
    <li>Users are represented by their avatars.</li>
    <li>And more...</li>
  </ul>

<h2>How does this compare to Paratext?</h2>

<p>Paratext is a very powerful piece of software, much more powerful than Bible Beehive. If you are happy with Paratext, and if you are confident that your team will be able to learn Paratext, you should probably use Paratext instead of Bible Beehive.</p>

<h2>What technology does Bible Beehive use behind the scenes?</h2>

<p>Bible Beehive is built using Python, Django, PostgreSQL, and Vue, alongside
the standard web technologies (HTML, CSS, Javascript).</p>

<h2>What features will Bible Beehive have in the future?</h2>

<p>This will entirely depend on the needs of its users, so please get in touch!
I personally would like to make it integrate better with Paratext.</p>

<h2>Why is the software named "Bible Beehive"?</h2>

<p>This is just a working title, and it may be changed in the future. The name
of beehive is meant to invoke the idea of collaboration.</p>

<h2>Can I see some screenshots?</h2>

<p>I'll be adding some screenshots to this page soon! (I need to anonymize the screenshots first.)</p>

<h2>I know you are looking for feedback. How can I contact you?</h2>

<p>Yes, please tell us if you are interested in this project! Would it serve your needs? What would you need in Bible translation software?</p>

<p>Contact us using <a href="https://forms.gle/AS6XUwPbHQzsNzj97">this contact form</a>.</p>

<h2>How can I receive updates about this project?</h2>

<p>Please fill in <a href="https://forms.gle/AS6XUwPbHQzsNzj97">the contact form</a> and make sure to indicate that you want to receive updates over email.</p>

<h2>How can I start using this software?</h2>

<p>Bible Beehive is currently being used by one team.
If you would like to use it too, or to try it out, please let me know by <a href="https://forms.gle/AS6XUwPbHQzsNzj97">contacting me</a>.</p>

<h2>Is Bible Beehive open source?</h2>

<p>Yes, Bible Beehive is open source, according to <a href="https://opensource.org/osd">the Open Source definition</a>.
It also free (as in freedom) software according to <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html">the Free Software Foundation</a>.
To request a copy of the source code, use the <a href="https://forms.gle/AS6XUwPbHQzsNzj97">the contact form</a>.
</p>

<h2>Is Bible Beehive free of charge?</h2>

<p>Since Bible Beehive is open source and free/libre, it can be redistributed free of charge.</p>

<p>So far, Bible Beehive was developed just for the needs of one particular
team. I am trying to discover if there is a need for this software outside of
our team. If there is, then we would invest more in this software
and we would look for ways to make its development sustainable. This may mean
entail charging for the software (while remaining open source), or it may mean
applying for grants, or alternatively, forming a community of volunteers
motivated in part by open source values. I'm not sure
which will be the best path forward, so please <a
href="https://forms.gle/AS6XUwPbHQzsNzj97">contact me</a> and help me figure
this out!</p>
